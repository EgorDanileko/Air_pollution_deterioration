# Air pollution deterioration
  Air pollution is measured at a busy part of the city each day in the morning and in the
evening.
  Write a program that gives us how many days were when the morning measurement was
bigger than the morning measurement of the previous day, and the evening measurement
was also bigger than the evening measurement of the previous day.
